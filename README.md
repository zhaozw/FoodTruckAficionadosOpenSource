# This is my README for the Google Play Store app, Food Truck Aficionados Free

I've been asked about the name of my app. I'm a fan of irony.

This is open-source code I've made available for the app I have in the play store at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.justin.freetruckfinder.app

Deleted the non-sense from several months back. V 2.0 is near. 

UPDATE AUGUST 2014: REFACTORING NEAR COMPLETE, UPDATES FORTHCOMING TO APP IN PLAYSTORE
COMPARE OLDER COMMITS WITH THE NEWEST COMMIT AND NOTE THE PROGRESS, FEEDBACK IS WELCOME.
