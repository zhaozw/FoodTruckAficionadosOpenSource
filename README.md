# This is my README for the Google Play Store app, Food Truck Aficionados Free

This is open-source code I've made available for the app I have in the play store at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.justin.freetruckfinder.app

I want to share this code so that everyone can have access to any components they may find of use to them.

Keep in mind the FourSquare clientID and clientSecret are no longer valid, and the Google Places API key is no longer valid either. 

This version is some days prior to the first version I published. It's almost exactly the same project except that the one I use for the Play Store has code that is better organized. For version control reasons, I'm not able to include that version, but I'll enjoy manually re-factoring my code once again sometime in the next couple weeks.

RE-FACTORED CLEAN CODE COMING IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS...
